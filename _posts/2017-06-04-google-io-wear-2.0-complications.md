Google IO just happened, and Google just announced some changes to Wear 2.0.  Also I finally received 2.0 on my Moto360 2nd Gen, so I've now unlocked the roadmap to publishing Dotface to the Google Play store.  The major goal for 1.0 is to support a single complication.

# Google IO, Wear 2.0 Updates

Google IO 2017 announced a few things for Wear 2.0:

Android Wear support libraries will be included in the regular Android Support libraries. Accordingly, will also be open source, so I can look forward to closing

ComplicationDrawable and TextRenderer are new components to aid implementing Complications.

# Complications

Now, my weekend progress and requirements for this issue, which I will scope for 1.0 release:
* Support for one device Moto 360 2nd Gen
* Complication can be configured to 1) off 2) small circle TYPE_SHORT_TEXT, all system providers.  
* Wear Configuration activity
* Complication is tappable
* Pass complication test suite

Explicitly not in scope:
* Multiple complications.  One or none.
* Color choice.  Blue only.
* Border choice.  Only on normally, not in ambient.
* Complications I would actually use: #12

# Current issues

Using AS 2.3.2, wear-support 2.0.2, still can't view source (Only IntelliJ decompiled code), hopefully when the O SDK is final support-lib 26 will include wear support source. AS 3.0 was also released and looks exciting. Will wait for those releases to report some issues I have experienced.

ComplicationDrawable requires using XML. My initial attempt at using was only through code setters(), and this resulted in nothing being drawn normally, but the ComplicationDrawable could successfully paint in ambient mode. When I finally realized I needed the XML - which is admittedly a more natural way to control its settings - I was able to get ComplicationDrawable to react reliably.

However, using the XML has its own grossenss, AS 2.3.2 red squiggles the file with "Element android.support.wearable.complications.rendering.ComplicationDrawable must be declared". This causes AS to red squiggle the following nodes in the project view: drawable, res, main, src, app, dotface. Builds without incident, though.

Also just having general problems running a WatchFace on a device or emulator. Sometimes it works, sometimes not - even the watch face generated by the AS Wizard or the GitHub samples.

I am expecting some of these issues to be resolved by upgrading to AS 3.0.
* Emulators are also being updated, now they include the Play Store
* Support lib and Google Maven Repo included
