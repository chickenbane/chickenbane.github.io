Feeling productive!

Once dotface complication support really solidified - when I could configure it to any of the default / system complication providers and they all rendered acceptably - I felt I was ready for release.

This meant getting exposed to a lot of non-engineering tasks.  Setting up the Play Store Developer console.  Creating a release build and signing it.  (In turn, signing meant creating a key store and a signing key.)  Creating assets for the Play Store.  First release had a crasher that took a small amount of debugging.  Quickly resolved and accepted into the Android Wear section of the store.  In retrospect, good experience.

Currently at 7 installs.  Pumped!

Last weekend I also completed the Android Developer Certification provided by Google + Udacity.  In short, you pay $149. You are given a basic app in an incomplete state.  Finish the app given certain requirements. Debug some problems. Add some tests.  Submit app in 48 hours.  Then upload photos of you and your id for identity verification.  Do a short and unpleasant interview to confirm you are a human Android developer.
